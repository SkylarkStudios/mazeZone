				If you would like to help with development of this game you can apply to be a music artist, artist, level designer, or game tester. <br>
Whether it be allowing us to use some of your music, testing our game, or helping us make music and art it would be appreciated. <br>
			</p>
			<h1> Keep in mind this is not a paid job and is just a hobby project! </h1>
<p>
I'm planning on releasing a lite version of the game and a paid version. <br>
For now this project is non profit but I may do optional rev-share in the future. <br>
Keep in mind the direction for this game is un-decided and could change.
